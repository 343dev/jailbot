# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repository root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill, reached through `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`, creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-example-decision.md
│   └── 0002-another-decision.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept isn't in the glossary, either the language doesn't match the project or there is a genuine gap to note for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
